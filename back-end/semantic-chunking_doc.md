## Introduction

# Introduction

The `prompt_builder.py` file is part of the natural language processing pipeline, specifically focusing on constructing prompts for language models. It appears to be responsible for taking raw text and transforming it into a structured format suitable for prompt-based inference. This module likely plays a crucial role in how the system interacts with and queries language models, influencing the quality and relevance of the generated responses.

The primary function of this module is to build and format prompts. This involves processing input text to detect language and then constructing a prompt that includes this information, potentially for multilingual or language-specific model interactions.

## Architecture and Components

The `prompt_builder.py` module primarily contains a single function, `build_markdown_prompt`, which handles the core logic for prompt construction.

### `build_markdown_prompt` Function

This function takes raw text as input and aims to construct a Markdown-formatted prompt.

*   **Language Detection:** It first attempts to detect the language of the input text. If the input text contains only alphanumeric characters and is less than or equal to 127 characters, it's considered potentially English. This heuristic is used to identify the language.
*   **Prompt Formatting:** Based on the detected language, it constructs a prompt. The current implementation specifically targets Vietnamese language detection and formatting. If the input is detected as Vietnamese, it returns a specific Vietnamese string. Otherwise, it returns an empty string.
*   **Output:** The function returns a string representing the formatted prompt.

## Data Flow and Interactions

The `build_markdown_prompt` function receives raw text as input and processes it to determine the appropriate prompt format.

## Query Service API

# Query Service API

The Query Service API is a backend component responsible for handling and processing user queries. It acts as an intermediary between the frontend and the underlying data sources, abstracting the complexity of data retrieval and manipulation. Its primary role is to receive query requests, orchestrate the necessary operations to fulfill them, and return the results in a structured format. This system interacts with various data parsing and retrieval mechanisms to serve information efficiently.

## Core Components and Responsibilities

The Query Service API is structured around several key components, each with distinct responsibilities:

### Query Processing Pipeline

This pipeline orchestrates the flow of a query from its reception to the final response. It involves several stages to ensure efficient and accurate query resolution.

*   **Request Handling:** The API receives incoming query requests.
*   **Parsing and Validation:** Incoming requests are parsed to extract query parameters and validated to ensure they conform to expected formats and constraints.
*   **Orchestration:** The service orchestrates the retrieval and processing of data based on the validated query. This may involve interacting with different modules for data extraction and manipulation.
*   **Response Generation:** Formats the processed data into a suitable response structure for the client.

### Document and Table Extraction

This system is designed to extract specific information from documents and tables, likely for structured data retrieval.

*   **Paragraph Extraction:** Identifies and extracts paragraphs from documents.
*   **Table Extraction:** Identifies and extracts tables from documents.
*   **Element Identification:** It can identify specific elements within documents or tables based on their tags or content. For instance, it can find elements ending with a 'p' tag or 'tbl' tag.

#### Data Extraction Logic

The logic for extracting data from documents and tables involves identifying relevant elements based on their tags and context.

*   **Paragraph Identification:** The system identifies paragraphs that are likely to contain relevant information.
*   **Table Identification:** It specifically looks for elements that represent tables.
*   **Conditional Extraction:** Extraction logic includes conditions such as checking if an element's tag ends with 'p' or 'tbl'.

### Information Retrieval

This component is responsible for fetching relevant data based on the processed query.

*   **Document Retrieval:** Retrieves relevant documents based on the query.
*   **Search Keyword Matching:** It uses similarity search on vector representations of documents to find relevant information.

### Vector Storage and Retrieval

The system utilizes vector storage for efficient similarity searches.

*   **Vector Storage:** Stores vector representations of documents or text chunks.
*   **Similarity Search:** Performs similarity searches on the vector store to find relevant documents or text segments based on a given query vector.

### Prompt Generation

The system constructs prompts for language models based on retrieved information.

*   **Context Assembly:** It assembles relevant context from retrieved documents and search results.
*   **Prompt Formatting:** Formats the context and the user's query into a prompt suitable for a language model.

## Architecture and Data Flow

The Query Service API follows a layered architecture to manage the complexity of query processing and data retrieval.

### Overall System Flow

A typical query flow involves the following steps:

1.  A user query is received by the API.
2.  The query is parsed and validated.
3.  Relevant documents are retrieved from storage.
4.  Information is extracted from these documents, including paragraphs and tables.
5.  A similarity search is performed using vector embeddings to find the most relevant information.
6.  The retrieved information is used to construct a prompt for a language model.
7.  The language model processes the prompt and generates a response.

## Document Upload and Processing

# Document Upload and Processing

The Document Upload and Processing system is responsible for handling the ingestion and initial processing of various document types within the application. It serves as a crucial gateway for documents, enabling their subsequent analysis and integration into the system's workflows. This system interacts with other components to manage document storage, metadata extraction, and initial validation.

Sources: [src/upload/document.py]

## Core Components and Responsibilities

The system can be broadly categorized into the following key components:

### Document Ingestion and Validation

This component is responsible for receiving uploaded documents, performing initial validation checks, and preparing them for further processing. It identifies the document type and ensures that the uploaded file meets basic requirements.

Sources: [src/upload/document.py]

### Document Parsing and Chunking

This component handles the process of parsing different document formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX, images) and breaking them down into smaller, manageable chunks. This chunking is essential for downstream processing, particularly for natural language processing tasks.

Sources: [src/upload/document.py], [src/upload/utils.py]

### Metadata Extraction

This component is responsible for extracting relevant metadata from the uploaded documents. This metadata can include information such as file name, file type, size, and upload timestamp.

Sources: [src/upload/document.py]

### Asynchronous Processing

The system leverages asynchronous processing to handle document uploads and processing efficiently. This allows for non-blocking operations, ensuring that the application remains responsive during potentially long-running tasks.

Sources: [src/upload/document.py]

## Architecture and Data Flow

The Document Upload and Processing system follows an asynchronous, event-driven architecture.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Uploads Document] --> B{Document Ingestion};
    B --> C{Validation};
    C -- Valid --> D{Parsing & Chunking};
    C -- Invalid --> E[Error Handling];
    D --> F{Metadata Extraction};
    F --> G[Store Processed Chunks];
    G --> H[Trigger Downstream Processing];
    E --> H;
```

This diagram illustrates the general flow of a document from upload to processing. A document is first ingested and validated. If valid, it proceeds to parsing and chunking, followed by metadata extraction. The processed chunks are then stored, and downstream processing is triggered. Invalid documents are handled by an error mechanism.

Sources: [src/upload/document.py]

### Document Processing Pipeline

The processing of a document involves several sequential steps, managed asynchronously.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant UploadService
    participant Parser
    participant ChunkProcessor
    participant MetadataExtractor
    participant Storage

    User->>UploadService: Upload Document
    activate UploadService
    UploadService->>Parser: Parse Document (e.g., PDF, DOCX)
    activate Parser
    Parser-->>UploadService: Parsed Content
    deactivate Parser
    UploadService->>ChunkProcessor: Chunk Content
    activate ChunkProcessor
    ChunkProcessor-->>UploadService: Processed Chunks
    deactivate ChunkProcessor
    UploadService->>MetadataExtractor: Extract Metadata
    activate MetadataExtractor
    MetadataExtractor-->>UploadService: Extracted Metadata
    deactivate MetadataExtractor
    UploadService->>Storage: Store Chunks and Metadata
    activate Storage
    Storage-->>UploadService: Confirmation
    deactivate Storage
    UploadService-->>User: Processing Complete/Status
    deactivate UploadService
```

This sequence diagram outlines the interactions between different services during document processing. The `UploadService` orchestrates the process, delegating tasks to specialized components like the `Parser`, `ChunkProcessor`, and `MetadataExtractor`.

## Semantic Search and Querying

# Semantic Search and Querying

Semantic Search and Querying is a core component responsible for enabling sophisticated search capabilities within the system. It leverages natural language processing and vector embeddings to understand the meaning and context of queries, retrieving relevant documents or data points that match the semantic intent rather than just keyword matching. This system is designed to handle multi-format documents and aims to provide a more intuitive and accurate search experience.

The primary components involved in semantic search and querying include the ingestion pipeline for processing documents, the storage and retrieval mechanisms for embeddings, and the querying interface that translates user input into semantic search operations.

## Core Components and Responsibilities

### Document Ingestion and Processing

The system processes various document types to extract meaningful information for semantic search. This involves parsing different file formats and preparing the content for embedding.

*   **Document Parsing:** The system is designed to handle multiple document formats. This is achieved through dedicated parsing logic for each type.
    *   Sources: `src/upload/domain/parser/extractor.py`
*   **Chunking:** Large documents are segmented into smaller, manageable chunks. This is crucial for effective embedding and retrieval, as it allows for more granular matching of semantic meaning.
    *   Sources: `src/upload/domain/parser/extractor.py`
*   **Embedding Generation:** Text chunks are converted into numerical vector representations (embeddings) using language models. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text.
    *   Sources: `src/query/domain/infra/retriever.py`

### Semantic Search and Retrieval

This part of the system handles the core logic of searching and retrieving relevant information based on semantic similarity.

*   **Vector Storage and Retrieval:** Embeddings are stored in a vector database or similar structure, allowing for efficient similarity searches.
    *   Sources: `src/query/domain/infra/retriever.py`
*   **Similarity Search:** Given a query embedding, the system finds the most similar document embeddings in the database.
    *   Sources: `src/query/domain/infra/retriever.py`
*   **Query Processing:** User queries are transformed into embeddings, and the system identifies relevant document chunks based on these embeddings.
    *   Sources: `src/query/domain/infra/retriever.py`

### Data Handling and Formatting

The system includes utilities for managing and formatting data, particularly for tabular data and image processing.

*   **Table Processing:** The system can identify and process tabular data within documents, converting it into a structured format suitable for analysis or embedding.
    *   Sources: `src/upload/domain/parser/extractor.py`
*   **Image Handling:** While not explicitly detailed for semantic search, the presence of image processing components suggests that visual information might be incorporated or handled in some capacity.
    *   Sources: `src/upload/domain/parser/extractor.py`

## Architecture and Flow

The overall architecture involves a pipeline where documents are ingested, processed, embedded, and then made available for semantic querying.

## Frontend: Document Upload Interface

# Frontend: Document Upload Interface

The Document Upload Interface is a core frontend component responsible for handling the user's interaction with the document upload functionality. It manages the selection of files, displays upload progress, and communicates with the backend API for processing. This interface is crucial for enabling users to submit various document types, such as PDFs, DOCX, images, and XLSX files, to the system.

## Core Components and Responsibilities

The system can be broken down into the following key components:

### Document Upload Logic

This component handles the core logic for managing file uploads. It is responsible for:
*   Accepting a list of files for upload.
*   Processing each file, including determining its type and size.
*   Tracking the status of each upload (e.g., processing, completed, error).
*   Calculating and reporting progress metrics for each file and the overall upload.
*   Handling potential errors during the upload process.

Sources: `src/upload/api/upload.py`

### File Type Handling

This component defines the acceptable types of documents that can be uploaded. It specifies the file extensions or MIME types that are considered valid for processing.

Sources: `frontend/types/document.ts`

### Upload State Management

This component manages the state of the document upload process. It tracks information such as:
*   The list of files currently being uploaded.
*   The status of each individual file upload (e.g., 'processing', 'processed', 'error').
*   Counts of total, successful, and failed uploads.
*   The total number of chunks processed and embeddings created.
*   Timestamps for processing and embedding creation.
*   Any error messages associated with failed uploads.

Sources: `frontend/types/document.ts`

### Upload Response Handling

This component is responsible for processing the responses received from the backend API after a file upload attempt. It interprets the status and any associated messages to update the overall upload state and inform the user.

Sources: `frontend/types/document.ts`, `src/upload/api/upload.py`

## Architecture and Flow

The document upload process involves several key interactions between components.

### Upload Process Flow

The typical flow for uploading documents is as follows:

1.  **File Selection:** The user selects one or more files through the interface.
2.  **File Processing:** The frontend component processes the selected files, validating their types and sizes against the defined requirements.
3.  **API Request:** For each valid file, an API request is made to the backend to initiate the upload.
4.  **Backend Processing:** The backend service receives the file, processes it (e.g., chunking, embedding generation), and returns a status.
5.  **Response Handling:** The frontend component receives the backend response and updates the upload state accordingly.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Selects Files] --> B{File Validation};
    B -- Valid --> C[Upload API Request];
    B -- Invalid --> D[Show Error];
    C --> E{Backend Processing};
    E -- Success --> F[Update UI: Success];
    E -- Error --> G[Update UI: Error];
    F --> H[Upload Complete];

## Upload Service API

# Upload Service API

The Upload Service API is a critical component responsible for handling the ingestion and processing of various document types within the system. It orchestrates the workflow from receiving uploaded files to their eventual processing and status tracking. This service interacts with other parts of the system to manage document metadata, processing states, and potential errors.

The core function of the Upload Service API is to provide a robust and scalable mechanism for document uploads. It defines the expected structure for uploaded documents, including their identification, naming, type, size, and processing status. The API also manages the lifecycle of an upload, from initial submission to completion or failure.

## Core Components and Responsibilities

### Document Upload Processing

The upload process involves receiving files, validating their types, and initiating their processing. The system categorizes documents based on their file types, such as PDF, DOCX, XLSX, and images. Each uploaded document is assigned a unique identifier and metadata related to its upload and processing status.

Sources: `src/upload/api/routers/document.py`, `frontend/types/document.ts`

### Data Structures

The API defines interfaces for document objects and upload results, specifying the expected data fields and their types.

*   **Document Interface:**
    *   `id`: string (unique identifier)
    *   `name`: string
    *   `type`: "pdf" | "docx" | "image" | "xlsx"
    *   `size`: number
    *   `uploadedAt`: Date
    *   `status`: "processing" | "processed" | "error"

*   **UploadResult Interface:**
    *   `filename`: string
    *   `status`: "success" | "error"
    *   `message`: string
    *   `processed_chunks`: number
    *   `embeddings_created`: number
    *   `processing_time`: number | null
    *   `error`: string | null

Sources: `frontend/types/document.ts`

### API Endpoints

The Upload Service API exposes several endpoints for managing document uploads.

| Endpoint       | Method | Description                                                                    |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/upload`      | POST   | Uploads documents and initiates their processing.                               |
| `/upload/list` | GET    | Retrieves a list of uploaded documents and their processing status.             |
| `/upload/{id}` | GET    | Retrieves details for a specific uploaded document.                            |
| `/upload/{id}` | DELETE | Deletes a specific uploaded document.                                          |

Sources: `src/upload/api/routers/document.py`

## Architecture and Data Flow

The Upload Service API acts as the entry point for document uploads. Upon receiving a file, it validates the file type and then passes it to the appropriate processing pipeline. This pipeline may involve chunking the document, creating embeddings, and updating the status.

### Document Upload Workflow

1.  **File Upload:** A client sends a file to the `/upload` endpoint.
2.  **Validation:** The service validates the file type and other constraints.
3.  **Processing Initiation:** If valid, the file is queued for processing.
4.  **Chunking and Embedding:** The document is chunked, and embeddings are generated for each chunk.
5.  **Status Update:** The status of the upload is updated throughout the process.
6.  **Result Reporting:** The final status and any relevant information are returned to the client.
